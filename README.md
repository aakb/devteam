# Dev Team pattern lab

An [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) starting point.

## Pattern Lab

Prerequisites: [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.

In the `pattern-lab` directory run:

```sh

If everything went well you should now be able to generate the static Pattern Lab site. In the `pattern-lab` directory run:

```sh
php core/console --generate
```
